<h2 class="autoShow">What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?
</h2>
<p class="autoShow">   The first thing I noticed was the words that followed my mouse when I moved the cursor. I like this interaction a lot because it’s almost like a paintbrush. It immediately made me interested in the page and the content of the texts following the cursor. As the first notable interaction I have with the website, it’s quite surprising how natural I discovered it. There wasn’t a “click me” notification when they ask me to play the sound, but it’s more subtle. I could very well skipped this if I didn’t move my mouse around and just scroll down right away. The fact that many elements in the page (how the line drawing follow the cursor, how the text stretch out when you scroll or drag it on) are being trusted that it would be discovered by the viewer is very nice.</p>
</div>

<div class="para2">
<h2 class="autoShow">Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.</h2>
<p class="autoShow"> I first scrolled down the page, then stopped to hover the mouse over the “Sculpting Harmony” text. Using the white texts appear after the mouse’s path, I played around for a while, trying to read the uncoherent texts.  I then dragged the “Sculpting Harmony” text, making it stretch out and the background colours change. I scrolled down to the next section and spent a good minute going back and forth trying to understand how they make the video and text responsive to the mouse scrolling. Then come the “Ship in the box” section of the page and immediately I can see a lot happening all at once. The scribble line is zoom out as I scroll down, I can also see the site have separate lines responding in different timing to the mouse. Another subtle but good effect is the black bold text, as they appear gradually with each letter when I scroll down, but keep the text in place when I scrolled to another content. As I learn more about CSS, I can realized that they have two separate command in place for this, which baffled me quite a bit.</p>
</div>

<div class="para3">
  <h2 class="autoShow">What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</h2>
  <p class="autoShow">  I spent the most time on the section transitions because of how smooth and interesting the changes from sketches into videos were. In particular, the first section have the viewer transition to a new media (still image to video) through keeping the familiarity (the sketch to the study model) then using familiar shape language (square) to transition to a new scene. And what do this new scene have? Familiar colours. Black and white are neutrals, and the only other colours are the blue of the wall(a colour that will appear later) and the green of the chair(the colour of the sections before and after this video). The attention to details make me come back to this section quite often as a result.</p>
  </div>

<div class="para4">
  <h2 class="autoShow">What was the most common action in your two-minute interaction with the experience?</h2>
  <p class="autoShow"> The action I repeated most was scrolling and then stopping. I scrolled down to look at the transition, ponder for a while then going back and forth the transition again and again. The butter smooth transition make this feel satisfying rather than repetitive, and I ended up just enjoying the website without thinking much about it more often than not.</p>
  </div>

<div class="para5">
  <h2 class="autoShow">What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</h2>
  <p class="autoShow"> The intended primary goal of the interactive experience is to make the viewer interested in the building, giving them a sense of community by letting them hear about the architecture, the passion, and the difficulties of the designer. From that, it makes them curious and want to know more about the place. By creating a strong first impression, the site aims to immerse visitors immediately with visuals, sound, and smooth motion to make them more interested in interacting with the website and, as a by product, the content itself.</p>
</div>

<div class="para6">
  <h2 class="autoShow">How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?</h2>
  <p class="autoShow"> The site uses interaction and design choices to highlight its purpose. Cursor-responsive text, colour shifts, and smooth transitions keep the user’s focus active. The layering of sketches, models, and real footage shows the step by step process of design, reinforcing the educational aim while keeping navigation simple.</p>
</div>

<div class="para7">
  <h2 class="autoShow">What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)</h2>
<p class="autoShow"> I think the website would be experience 2-3 times for 5 mins each. First time: take the most time, most people would just scrolling up and down, focusing on the interaction and enjoying the visual. Second time: the viewer would focus more on the content, some might end the experience here. Third time: having a quick scroll, looking at the transition one last time.</p>
</div>

<div class="para8">
  <h2 class="autoShow">How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be interacted with over time?</h2>
  <p class="autoShow"> I feel like the atmosphere and interactivity of the site would make people want to come back to experience it again. The way the site displays information in a clean and concise manner makes it feel like a museum. The audio of the video have a documentary feeling to it, which adds on to this effect. I think the way the site place text and images also play a part in this, as both are place in a way that leave a lot of blank space, adding to the community feeling of “the extra space is so that somebody standing next to me can also read this”.</p>
  </div>

<div class="para9">
  <h2 class="autoShow">What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</h2>
  <p class="autoShow"> The site uses film techniques like zooming and panning on video and images, and having images move at different times to create a 3D effect. Using video footage of the building, the site zooms into and out of the building at the start and end of the experience, imitating the physical feeling of going through the place itself. Additionally, the architectural drafts paired with the big bold letters make it look like a promotional leaflet for the orchestra to me.</p>
</div>

<div class="para10">
  <h2 class="autoShow">What do these references communicate to you about how you should act when engaging with your research experience?</h2>
  <p class="autoShow">  They suggest that I should treat it like a gallery or a film. I should move through slowly, section by section, and let the transitions guide me. The site is designed to control my pacing, letting me know when to pause, watch, or interact. When it want me to interact, there would be a lot of blank space. It would stop the scrolling animation and have me scroll to reveal text when it want me to stop, read, and thinking. And it would have a video playing when it want me to watch and focus.</p>
  </div>

<div class="para11">
  <h2 class="autoShow">What do these references communicate to you about how you should feel when engaging with your research experience?</h2>
  <p class="autoShow"> They show me that I should focus on careful observation rather than speed, paying attention to detail the same way I would in a gallery. It encourages steady viewing and revisiting sections as needed.</p>
</div>

<div class="para12">
  <h2 class="autoShow">What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what makes that part frustrating?</h2>
  <p class="autoShow">  The most frustrating part is how hard it is to find past information. While it is very fun to go through the website, when I want to go back and find certain texts and if it only appear while scrolling, then it is very difficult to find.  I think this is ok in this instance since I think leaving an everlasting impression is important for this website, but I think a more education focused webpage wouldn’t fit this type of format.</p>
  </div>

<div class="para13">
  <h2 class="autoShow">What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what makes that part satisfying?</h2>
  <p class="autoShow">The most satisfying part for me is the sections that have multiple videos as backgrounds. I really like how smooth the transitions for both the visuals and the text are. It feels like I’m in a cinema since there’s always motion whether or not I chose to scroll or not. While all 3 videos is transition through the same hard cut technique, I think it’s nice that the subject matter is change in each video, with the first having shots of each part of the orchestra, the second have shots of the conductor, and the third have shots of the audience. The music is also very nice. I like how it changes every time I get to a new section, audibly signaling to the viewer that this section is new and waking them up, making them re-engage with the website again.</p>
