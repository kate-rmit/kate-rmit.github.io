/* after watching some youtube video about interactivities in web design, I saw that 
many people advised changing the unit of measurement to vw and rem so that the web
would scale when making the web bigger or smaller. This was also your advice for me 
in the last assignment, so I was really interested in trying it out
I mostly coded on my laptop, so for the most part I didnt have any issues with the 
interactivities, but when I switched into the mac wacom in the school, the web
layout are distorded whenever I scale the web page, which was quite shocking for me haha

so the lace act as the frame to the video.
this might be due to a different in computer setting but the colour display of the lace on
my computer(window) and the school computer(mac) is very different,
which is very interesting to me. the frame on the mac is white but when i screenshot it, it
is black instead, similar to the window display. This might be a problem of different
browser instead, since i had to use safari on the mac
