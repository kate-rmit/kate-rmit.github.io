<h2>What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?
</h2>
<p>  The first thing I noticed was the words that followed my mouse when I moved the cursor. I like this interaction a lot because it’s almost like a paintbrush. It immediately made me interested in the page and the content of the texts following the cursor.</p>
</div>

<div class="para2">
<h2>Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.</h2>
<p> I first scrolled down the page, then stopped to hover the mouse over the moving words. I dragged some words and saw the background colours change. I scrolled back up to check the transitions again, refreshed the page to replay the introduction, and then started scrolling up and down in every section to look at the transitions.</p>
</div>

<div class="para3">
  <h2>What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</h2>
  <p> I spent the most time on the section transitions because of how smooth and interesting the changes from sketches into videos were. I really like the fact that new music and visuals (new colours, real-life videos, gifs, etc.) appear every time it gets to a new section. It shows that the site wants to engage all the senses of the viewer in this experience.</p>
</div>

<div class="para4">
  <h2>What was the most common action in your two-minute interaction with the experience?</h2>
  <p> The action I repeated most was scrolling and then stopping. I scrolled down to see what would happen, then paused to let the animation finish. Sometimes I scrolled back up to replay the transition again.</p>
</div>

<div class="para5">
  <h2>What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</h2>
  <p> The intended primary goal of the interactive experience is to make the viewer interested in the building, giving them a sense of community by letting them hear about the architecture, the passion, and the difficulties of the designer. From that, it makes them curious and want to know more about the place. By creating a strong first impression, the site aims to immerse visitors immediately with visuals, sound, and smooth motion to make them more interested in interacting with the website and, as a by product, the content itself.</p>
</div>

<div class="para6">
  <h2>How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?</h2>
  <p> The site uses interaction and design choices to highlight its purpose. Cursor-responsive text, colour shifts, and smooth transitions keep the user’s focus active. The layering of sketches, models, and real footage shows the step by step process of design, reinforcing the educational aim while keeping navigation simple.</p>
</div>

<div class="para7">
  <h2>What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)</h2>
<p> I think the website would be experience 2-3 times for 5 mins each. First time: take the most time, most people would just scrolling up and down, focusing on the interaction and enjoying the visual. Second time: the viewer would focus more on the content, some might end the experience here. Third time: having a quick scroll, looking at the transition one last time.</p>
</div>

<div class="para8">
  <h2>How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be interacted with over time?</h2>
  <p> I feel like the atmosphere and interactivity of the site would make people want to come back to experience it again. The way the site displays information and content makes it feel like a museum. It feels like I could always come back and learn something new.</p>
</div>

<div class="para9">
  <h2>What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</h2>
  <p> The site uses film techniques like zooming and panning on video and images, and having images move at different times to create a 3D effect. Using video footage of the building, the site zooms into and out of the building at the start and end of the experience, imitating the physical feeling of going through the place itself. Additionally, the architectural drafts paired with the big bold letters make it look like a promotional leaflet for the orchestra to me.</p>
</div>

<div class="para10">
  <h2>What do these references communicate to you about how you should act when engaging with your research experience?</h2>
  <p> They suggest that I should treat it like a gallery or a film. I should move through slowly, section by section, and let the transitions guide me. The site is designed to control my pacing, letting me know when to pause, watch, or interact.</p>
</div>

<div class="para11">
  <h2>What do these references communicate to you about how you should feel when engaging with your research experience?</h2>
  <p> They show me that I should focus on careful observation rather than speed, paying attention to detail the same way I would in a gallery. It encourages steady viewing and revisiting sections as needed.</p>
</div>

<div class="para12">
  <h2>What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what makes that part frustrating?</h2>
  <p> The most frustrating part is how hard it is to find past information. While it is very fun to go through the website, when I want to go back and find certain texts, it is very difficult because I have to go through all the transitions again, which makes the information even harder to find.</p>
</div>

<div class="para13">
  <h2>What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what makes that part satisfying?</h2>
  <p>The most satisfying part for me is the sections that have multiple videos as backgrounds. I really like how smooth the transitions for both the visuals and the text are. It feels like I’m in a cinema, scrolling through the scenes, which is very fun. The music is also very nice. I like how it changes every time I get to a new section, audibly signaling to the viewer that this section is new and waking them up, making them re-engage with the website again.</p>
