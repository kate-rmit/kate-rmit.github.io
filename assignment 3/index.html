   <!-- As they begin to scroll, the guillotine blade descends and beheads Marie, marking the start of the narrative.
     The scrolling then transitions from vertical to horizontal, where her severed head spins and moves across the screen as
      information about the Revolution appears.
      This section becomes the main focus of engagement, combining motion, text, and visuals to reveal historical context. 
      The scrolling action itself is the most common and meaningful interaction, allowing the audience to control the pace and flow of the story. 
      The primary goal is to help users learn about the Revolution in a more active and memorable way, using animation and symbolism instead of static text. 
      The falling blade, spinning head, and final image of the head resting on a cake communicate both the chaos of the Revolution 
      and the irony of Marie Antoinette’s legacy. -->

<!-- The audience immediately notices the guillotine and Marie Antoinette’s head beneath it. 
 The scene creates tension and danger, making the website’s content clear that it’s about execution and revolution. 
 It blends tension and dark humor, creating a sense of unease and curiosity while keeping the topic engaging. -->

    <p>Marie Antoinette, the Queen of France, was executed by guillotine on October 16, 1793, during the French Revolution.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <p> Her death came after her husband, King Louis XVI, had been executed earlier in January 1793.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <p> This period was part of the Reign of Terror, when revolutionaries, led by the radical Jacobins, sought to eliminate perceived enemies of the Republic. </p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>Marie Antoinette’s execution symbolized the fall of the monarchy and the radical phase of the Revolution.</p>
</div>
<div><p>France then descended deeper into the Reign of Terror (1793–1794). </p></div>
<div><p>The Committee of Public Safety, led by Robespierre, intensified its crackdown on anyone suspected of opposing the revolution. </p></div>
<div> <p>Thousands were executed, including nobles, clergy, and even revolutionaries themselves. </p></div>
<div><p>Political instability and fear dominated France until Robespierre’s fall in 1794, which ended the Terror and led to a more moderate government called the Directory.</p></div>

<!-- The choice of transitioning Marie’s head to a cherry on top of a cake is a re-called to the famous iconic quote “Let them eat cake”. 
 Even though this quote had been proven to be untrue, it remains deeply ingrained in popular culture as a symbol of her perceived ignorance and detachment from the common people. 
 By referencing it visually, the design reinforces the irony of her public image and connects the historical narrative with the modern viewer’s collective memory. -->
